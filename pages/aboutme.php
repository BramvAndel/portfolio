                    I’m the older brother to two amazing sisters, and to many, I’m a friend. I try to be kind and supportive to everyone I meet, and I believe that respect and understanding are the foundations of good relationships. I think treating others with kindness and helping each other is really important. <br><br>

                    In my free time, you can find me programming, spending time with friends and family, or working out at the gym. Programming lets me think in new ways, while spending time with loved ones reminds me how important connection is. The gym helps me build discipline, strength, and focus—both in my body and mind. I also enjoy designing and solving problems, activities that allow me to be creative and keep learning. <br><br>

                    When I work, I aim for perfection while staying realistic about what can be achieved. If a client comes to me with an issue, I focus on finding a solution instead of getting into arguments. I work well in teams or alone, depending on what’s needed. If the leader steps back, I can quickly take charge to keep things organized and ensure everything stays on track. <br><br>

                    All in all, these experiences shape who I am—a person who values relationships, hard work, and growth. Whether it’s in my personal life or work, I always try to keep improving while staying true to my values of kindness, respect, and teamwork.
